# TreeSanitizer
A simple lightweight JavaScript class which can parse a nested object tree like JSON.
It ignores keys (or not) and/or sanitizes values based on rules depending on keys then returns a rebuilt object with the same structure.

Examples of how to extend the options, ignore and filter methods are in tests/core.js.
